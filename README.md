SDNET2018 is an image dataset that contains annotations for cracked and non-cracked concrete structures (bridge decks, walls, and pavement).

The data is organized in three subdirectories:

D contains bridge deck images
P contains pavement images
W contains wall images
Each of these subdirectories contains two additional prefixed subdirectories:

C is the prefix used for cracked surfaces
U is the prefix used for uncracked surfaces
